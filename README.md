This project is based on the **8-Week SQL Challenge** created by **Danny Ma**. The challenge includes multiple case studies designed to strengthen SQL skills through hands-on practice with real-world datasets.
Each case study involves analyzing data, writing SQL queries to answer business questions, and deriving insights. I will work through the case studies one by one and update this repository as I progress. Each case study will include an overview and solution files.
